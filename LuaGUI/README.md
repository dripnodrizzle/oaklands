# LuaGUI: Roblox GUI Creator (Prototype)

A basic drag-and-drop GUI creator app for Roblox GUIs.

## Features (MVP)
- Canvas for placing and resizing UI elements (Frame, TextLabel, ImageLabel, Button)
- Sidebar with draggable UI components
- Property editor for selected element (position, size, color, text, font, transparency, etc.)
- Simple hierarchy/tree view for parenting
- Export to Roblox Lua code (basic version)
- Built with React and TypeScript for web (easy to run locally or host)
- Project structure ready for future expansion (asset upload, advanced export, etc.)

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open in your browser and start building GUIs!

## Roadmap
- Asset upload (images, fonts)
- Advanced export (rbxm/rbxmx)
- More UI components
- Undo/redo
- User authentication (optional)
